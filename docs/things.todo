 - fix softmax grad (get idea from pytorch)
 - fix convolutional layer
 - add lr_finder (https://sgugger.github.io/how-do-you-find-a-good-learning-rate.html)
 - add 1cycle (https://sgugger.github.io/the-1cycle-policy.html)
 - add tensor impl (tensorflow or pytorch style)

 check:
 - derivatives to auto diff calculus tensor
 - try to represent loss functions as tensor op
